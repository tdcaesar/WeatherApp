# Weather App

## Overview

This app originated as a training project to learn SwiftUI.  It is a very simple app that uses the GPS to determine your location, passes your location to discover the closest NOAA weather station, and pulls the latest weather forecast from the selected NOAA station.  

## What's Next

The plan is to divide the project into a series segments illustrating the incremental building of features.
